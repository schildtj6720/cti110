<h1>Different Mediums used within the Art World...</h1>
  
<p>Similar to how there are many different types of art styles present within the art world, there are countless different mediums that artists use to create their work. Listed below are just a few examples of such tools. </p>

<h2>Paint</h2>
  
  <p>Paint a widely used tool that many artists use. It is a pigmented substance that can create vivid visuals from just the stroke of a brush. There are many different types of paint, which includes: oil, acrylic, watercolor, gloss, flat/matte, guoache, eggshell, and a variety of others...</p>  
  
<h2>Pencils</h2>
  
  <p>An instrument that is commonly used for sketching. It is a thin wooden tool with a stick of graphite or charcoal (material may vary) in the middle of it. Pencils are typically monochrome in nature, but colored pencils are available if an artist desires a pop of color in their work. It is the same formula, except instead of graphite, the inner core is pigmented.</p>    
  
<h2>Pastels/Chalks</h2>
  
  <p>Thick sticks of either pigment or mineral calcite. Pastels are typically softer in nature than sticks of chalk. Pastels do wonders when blending, and an artist can obtain a nice, luscious texture when using them in their work.</p> 
  
<h2>Markers</h2>
  
  <p>A pen that has it's own ink source. Results from using these are usually very bold and colorful. Artists can usually obtain multiple of them in single packs, though most craft stores have the option of buying single markers separetly in specific colors.</p> 
  
<h2>Clay</h2>
  
  <p>A moldable medium that is commonly used when creating sculptures. Clay can come in varying forms: earthenware, stoneware, ball, fire, porcelain, and air dry. With clay, artists are able to make models that are not restricted to the flatness of a piece of paper or a canvas.</p>   

<h2>Digital Art</h2>
  
  <p>Drawings, paintings, or sculptures created through digital means. It is recommended that artists wishing to draw digitally invest in a drawing tablet. Through digital art, artists can erase and modify their work quickly and without consequence. Materials typically do not run out when drawing with a creative program.</p>
